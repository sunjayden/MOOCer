                    As of 2018, there are 30 million registered users on
                    Coursera, 14 million on edX and 8 million users on Udacity.
                    The growth of Massive Open Online Course(MOOCs) has been
                    booming ever since Stephen Downes and Georgia Siemens
                    offered the first free course on Connectivism and
                    Connectivity Knowledge in 2008 with the intention to explore
                    possibilities of a richer learning made possible by online
                    tools. Ever since, there has been a massive increase in the
                    number of free courses available online ranging from every
                    aspect of knowledge and offered by many top universities and
                    companies around the globe. MOOCs were created with the
                    intention to bring about ease of learning by providing
                    unlimited participation and open access through web.
                    However, with the increasing options for courses among
                    multiple platforms such Coursera, edX, and Udacity users are
                    faced with choice overload that can hinder their learning.
                    In addition, studies show that out of all the people that
                    sign up for MOOCs only about 3.3 percent completed their
                    course in the year 2017-2018. One of the reasons why people
                    fail to complete their courses can be traced back to the
                    fact that there are so many platforms available which makes
                    it difficult to find the right courses, to keep track of
                    userâ€™s online portfolio, and track their course progresses.
                    With our project we want to build on top of the previous
                    MOOCer project to integrate more functionalities and
                    modularities to further facilitate online learning.
